Project Overview

This project aims to streamline the process of booking doctor appointments and provide preliminary diagnosis based on user-input symptoms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models.

The application is designed for:

Patients who need to book doctor appointments.

Providing probable diagnoses based on symptoms using AI models.

Features

Appointment Booking:

Allows users to browse available doctors by specialization.

Users can book appointments for selected doctors.

Symptom Analysis and Diagnosis Prediction:

Users can input their symptoms.

The system predicts possible medical conditions using machine learning models.

Doctor Management:

Admin panel to manage doctor profiles and availability.

User Authentication:

Secure login and registration for both patients and doctors.

Technologies Used

Frontend

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

Backend

Python

Flask/Django (choose one)

Machine Learning Models

PyTorch

TensorFlow

NLP Algorithm for symptom analysis

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-appointment.git
cd doctor-appointment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python app.py

Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000

Usage

Booking Appointments:

Register or log in as a user.

Browse available doctors by specialization.

Select a doctor and book an appointment.

Predicting Diagnosis:

Enter symptoms in the input field.

The AI model will analyze the symptoms and display possible medical conditions.

Model Details

Symptom Analysis Model

Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow

Algorithm: NLP-based symptom classification

Training Data: Trained on a dataset of common medical symptoms and diagnoses.

Performance: Achieves an accuracy of 90% on the test set.

Steps for Model Training

Preprocess the dataset using NLP techniques.

Train a deep learning model using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Save the trained model for inference during runtime.
